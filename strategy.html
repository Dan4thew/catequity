                <h2>REASON TO INVEST</h2>

              </div>

              <div>
                <h2>CASHFLOW</h2>
                <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/estate15.png">

                <span style="">Utilizing passive investments in commercial multifamily real estate is a viable proven way to invest in real estate without having to become a landlord. You can leverage professional expertise to create stable streams
                  of tax-advantaged passive income that can buy back your time from work so that you can do the things in life that matter most to you, and that is what makes passive income truly priceless. A stabilized multifamily asset can provide
                  a steady high single-digit annual cash flow during the hold period which gets distributed to investors on a quarterly basis.
                  .</span>

              <div>

                <h2>FORCED APPRECIATION</h2>
                <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/estate16.png">

                <span style="">Unlike residential home prices, commercial properties are valued by their income. We can add more value by increasing the income of the property. We find properties where we can make interior and exterior improvements
                  that positively impact tenants. By providing certain added amenities we attract and retain better tenants, and can charge rent premium or operate more efficiently, thus increasing the value when we sell or refinance. In addition to
                  generating passive income during the hold period, this additional value generated can net an additional 20%-40% of returns upon exit of the property.</span>
              </div>
              <hr>

              <div>


                <h2>TAX BENEFITS</h2>
                <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/estate17.png">

                <span style="">Multifamily offers several tax advantages that are not available for traditional investments like stocks or bonds. First, we get a deduction on the property depreciation which allows us to reduce the tax impact on real
                  income. With the new tax law, we can also benefit from cost segregation and bonus depreciation opportunities which allow us to accelerate certain depreciable components of the asset which can further reduce the tax impact. In
                  addition, when we sell the property, we can take advantage of the 1031 exchange option which allows us to indefinitely defer paying capital gains by rolling into another like kind asset. There are also refinancing opportunities
                  available which provide yet another way to increase the returns while reducing the tax impact.</span>
              </div>
              <hr>
              <div>
                <h2>FINANCING</h2>
                <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/estate18.png">

                <span style="">A number of financing options exist for multifamily projects, including loans from government-sponsored enterprises like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. These programs enhance the availability and reduce the cost of credit
                  for qualifying multifamily projects. On a typical project we can get anywhere from 75% – 80% loan to cost with 1-4 years of interest only option thus allowing us to maximize our investor returns on these projects. A lot of these
                  financing options are also non-recourse which lowers the risk to investors.</span>
              </div>
              <hr>
              <div>


                <h2>DEMAND</h2>
                <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/estate19.png">

                <span style="">In our current housing market, multifamily rental units are playing an increasingly important role by providing necessary housing solutions to those entering the rental market out of necessity, rather than by choice.
                  We believe the baseline level of demand will continue to be steady regardless of the state of the economy as people are going to need a place to live. According to Yardi, the national occupancy rate for stabilized multifamily assets
                  closed
                  out in 2021 at just over 96%.</span>
              </div>
              <hr>

              <div>


                <h2>COMMUNITY IMPACT</h2>
                <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/estate20.png">

                <span style="">We not only protect, build, and increase our investors’ capital but we do that while improving the communities that our tenants live in. We invest capital in updating our assets both from an exterior and interior to
                  provide a clean and safe living environment. We can proudly say that Catalyst Equity Partners along with our investors are changing communities one apartment at a time.</span>
